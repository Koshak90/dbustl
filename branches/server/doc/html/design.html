<h1><a class="anchor" name="design">Design paradigms </a></h1>DBus is a great tool for next generation Linux desktops or mobile devices, where it provides a robust mechanism for decoupling of applicative services (e.g.<p>
power management, networking, bluetooth, and so many other possible things) for the user of those services, such as configuration applets and other GUI oriented applications.<p>
DBusTL grew from the frustration that there was no easy way to use DBus with C++, apart from what ships with the famous Qt toolkit. There were some attempts such as dbus-cpp or dbus-c++, dbusmm, or cbus, but none were "feeling right" to me.<p>
From my point of view the ideal toolkit has the following properties:<ul>
<li>Be lightweight: don't pretend libdbus does not exist by creating one class per existing DBus concept, but just use libdbus' C functions when they can do the job.</li><li>Even if the internals are coded in C, provide a high-level, C++-ish interface to the end user.</li><li>Don't provide new data types for DBus types mapping: the user probably already has his own data types (STL or others), so just use them.</li><li>Provide integration with popular toolkits such as Glib, Qt</li><li>Use "modern" C++ techniques to make the user or developer's life easier when it makes sense.</li><li>Apart from asynchronous callbacks and signals, does not depend on an any external toolkit</li><li>When you need such an external toolkit for mainloop support, don't go in your way by implementing a heavyweight porting layer - just keep it simple.</li><li>Be feature complete enough not to go in your way when you just need to have your job done.</li></ul>
<p>
DBusTL is an attempt at fullfilling all those properties.<p>
DBusTL borrows some design ideas from Sergei Kuchin's OTL (<a href="http://otl.sourceforge.net">http://otl.sourceforge.net</a>), and i would not have had the courage to start this without this new C++ facility called Variadic templates (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B0x#Variadic_templates">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B0x#Variadic_templates</a>). </div>

     * Provides an abstraction of a DBus Connection. 
     * 
     * A DBUS connection is a dedicated link between two applications
     * that wish to exchange DBUS messages.
     * DBus connections can be either private (which is not supported
     * at the moment), or be connections to a bus, which is in charge
     * of routing messages to the right process.
     * 
     * A DBus Connection is needed to instantiate ServerProxy objects.
     * 
     * The simplest way to have a connection to a bus is through a call 
     * to Connection::systemBus or Connection::sessionBus
     * 
     * To be able to process signals, the connection must be associated 
     * with an event loop. An event loop must be provided either:
     *   - before any call to Connection::Connection, Connection::systemBus or Connection::sessionBus, using
     *     Connection::useEventLoop static member.
     *   - during object construction, through the use of 
     *     the alternate Connection(DBusBusType bustype, const EventLoopIntegration& eventLoop) constructor
     * 
     * If no signals are to be received, then event loop association 
     * remains optionnal.

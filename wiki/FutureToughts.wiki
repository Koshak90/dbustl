#summary What to expect in the future from DBUSTL (aka Roadmap)

This is some kind of a TODO list i have in mind at he moment:

  * Don't depend on dbus-glib for main loop integration, by really implementing !GlibEventLoop
  * Support for server side DBUS (i.e. expose C++ objects as DBUS objects)
  * Test exceptions less support
  * Support DBus variant type: don't know if that's really used

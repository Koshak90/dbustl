#summary What to expect in the future from DBUSTL (aka Roadmap)

This is some kind of a TODO list i have in mind at he moment:

  * Don't depend on dbus-glib for main loop integration
  * Support for server side DBUS (i.e. expose C++ objects as DBUS objects)
  * Choice to use or not to use C++ exceptions for the end user

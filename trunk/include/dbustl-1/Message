      * Message is a lightweight wrapper class around DBus C API DBusMessage struct.
      * 
      * This class encapsulates  a DBusMessage DBus C API object.
      * 
      * This class provides the following benefits over its C counterpart:
      *   - Partial encapsulation of a what a DBUS message is, so that the end user
      * does not have to manipulate the DBus C API directly.
      *   - Automatic reference counting of underlying C struct
      *   - operator >> to deserialize messages arguments
      *   - operator << to serialize messages arguments
      * 
      * This class is implicitly shared, which means that if you make a copy
      * of it, the new copy with share its internal data and state with the original.
      * 
      * Please note that as end user of DBus library, you are not supposed
      * to instantiate objects from this class by yourself, but use instances that
      * are built for your by DBUSTL.
      * 
      * You will have to use this class for signals reception or asynchronous
      * method calls reply. In all other cases everything should be handled
      * behind the scene for you.
      * 
      * This class provides a dbus() method that is public but that you are not
      * supposed to use, unless you *really* know what you are doing.
